# First Prediction Model : House price Prediction 
##  Prerequisites :
* Know the difference between Regression . Classification . Clustering
* Review the basic data preprocessing concepts
	* Simple Inputer
	* Label Encoder, OneHotEncoder, Dummy variables trap
	* train_test_split
	* StandardScaler


## Knowledge needed for this practical case
* Do your First Linear Regression with Scikit-Learn on DataCamp
* Do your first Multiple Linear Regression with Scikit-Learn
* Understand and apply the concept of Decision Tree ( Regression )
* Understand and apply the concept of Random Forest ( Regression )
* Understand and apply the concept of concept of SVR (SVM regression )
	* What is a Kernel, what are the main 3 types of SVM Kernel with Scikit-Learn


## Case :
Ask a home buyer to describe their dream house, and they probably won’t begin with the height of the basement ceiling or the proximity to an east-west railroad. But this playground competition’s dataset proves that much more influences price negotiations than the number of bedrooms or a white-picket fence.
With 79 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa,Here you will have to predict the price for each house in the test set. Then one who has the closest prediction wins the game ;)


## Once Done :

Use Pickle to export your model, it will be this file that we are going to test.
